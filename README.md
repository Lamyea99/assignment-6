  A README file to answer the following question-


 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
 answer:var-Function-scoped,can be re-declared,updated and hoisted.
 let-Block-scoped,can be updated and hoisted but can not be re-declared in the same scope.
 const-Block-scoped,can not be re-declared , value must be initialized at declaration.
 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 
answer:map()-Creates a new array by transforming each element.Returns same length array.
forEach()-Loops through elements and performs an action.Returns undefined.
filter()-Creates a new array with only elements that pass a condition.Returns a new array.
 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
answer:Arrow functions in ES6 are a shorter way to write functions using the => syntax.Shorter syntax than function.Best use for small,simple functions. 
 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
answer:In ES6,destructuring assignment unpacks values from arrays or properties from objects into variables in a concise way.Destructuring simplifies extracting data without needing multiple lines of code.
 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
 answer:In ES6,template literals are strings wrapped in backticks(``).it inserts variables/expressions directly using ${}.It is different from concatenation because concatenation joins strings with variables/expressions using (+) unlike template literals.Template literals are cleaner,support multi-line and allow embedded expressions easily.
